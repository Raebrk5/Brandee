		1. a 25 year old geographer who has spent the better half of my life in Texas. I attended <a href="http://www.southwestern.edu/departments/environmental/gis/"> Southwestern Univeristy </a> for a B&#46;A&#46; in Environmental Studies where I specialized in tech application. Following graduation I took a position with Apple INC where I gained experience in large tech GIS. After choosing to leave I took a position with Indeed.com. Today, I remian with Indeed.com as an automation project analyst on the lead generation team. In the evenings I take classes and am a teaching assistant at the University of Washington to get my M&#46;A&#46; in Geospatial Technology.

		In my personal life I live above an awesome brewery with my tiny dog. We enjoy hiking, exploring, and can be coaxed out with good food, libations, and friends. Most weekends I can be found enjoying a good cup of coffee, watching movies, or researching a couple different interests.
